# Youtube Downloader

Youtube downloader is a GUI helper for youtube-dl. It provides a graphical interface to add, track and remove videos from youtube. 

## Features

It allows for customizing your downloads:

## Usage

Youtube downloader's goal is a comfort, downloading a video from youtube is that kind of problem which everyone of us had at least once in life. Using this software is human friendly, to add your download you can just past link into input and hit enter or press button but I strongly recommend to just drag a youtube video's thumbnail and drop it into youtube downloader.
