# Youtube Downloader

Youtube downloader is a GUI helper for youtube-dl. It provides a graphical interface to add, track and remove videos from youtube. 

## Dependency

This software is based on PySide2 and youtube-dl.

## Features

It allows for customizing your downloads:

	- Select where a single download should be stored
	- What kind of file it should be
	- Pause and resume 

## Usage

Youtube downloader's goal is a comfort. To add your download you can just past link into input and hit enter or press button but I strongly recommend to drag a youtube video's thumbnail and drop it into youtube downloader.
